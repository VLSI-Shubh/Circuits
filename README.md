# ‚ö° Circuits

Welcome to the **Circuits** repository ‚Äî a personal collection of modular Verilog code for various **combinational** and **sequential** digital circuits. This repo is structured to serve as a reusable library of synthesizable modules that can be directly plugged into larger designs or used for quick prototyping and testing.

---

## üìò Description

This repository is primarily maintained as a hands-on space to:

- Keep foundational Verilog coding skills sharp.
- Build and reuse modular, **parameterized**, and **synthesizable** circuits.
- Organize circuit designs for future use in bigger projects.
- Maintain a clean library of tested and verified digital design blocks.

It contains two main directories:

- `combinational_circuits/`: for purely combinational logic modules.
- `sequential_circuits/`: for FSMs, memory blocks, counters, and other sequential modules.

Each module typically includes:
- Well-documented Verilog code
- Testbenches for functional simulation
- Output waveforms (via `.vcd` or `.png`)
- Optional synthesis reports 

For specific implementation details, please refer to the corresponding folders.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Each module is standalone. You can navigate to the folder of interest, copy the module code into your project, and run the testbench using a simulator like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, or EDA Playground.

Most of the modules are:
- **Parameterizable** (`width`, `depth`, etc.)
- **Reusable**
- **Synthesizable**

## üéØ Goal

This is not a tutorial-based repository ‚Äî the goal is to maintain a **clean, personal, and reusable circuit library** for design testing and future integration. If you're exploring this repo, feel free to use or modify the designs as needed.

## üì¨ Feedback or Contributions?

This is a personal repository maintained for practice and project reuse. However, if you have suggestions or find bugs, feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.
